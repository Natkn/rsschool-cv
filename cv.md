## About me
I don't have any experience in this field. I'm a very hard-working person, kind and undestanding. I graduaded from university almost a year ago and still couldn't find a cool job.  I studied linguistics so I know English and German but English is my passion. I was working at the call-center but didn't like it there so I quitted.And now I want to try my skills here even though I don't know anything. But I know I'll try my best. 

*********
## Code example: 

*const assert = require("chai").assert;*

*describe("Multiply", () => {*
 *it("fixed tests", () => {*
    *assert.strictEqual(multiply(1,1), 1);*
    
   *assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,1), 2);*
    
  *assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,2), 4);*
    
  *assert.strictEqual(multiply(3,5), 15);* 
    
*});*
  
*});*
